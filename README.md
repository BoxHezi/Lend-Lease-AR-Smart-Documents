# [ThingWorx IoT + AR Hackathon 2018](http://www.thingworxhacks.com/rmit/)

We were tasked with developing an innovative solution for a [LendLease](https://www.lendlease.com/au/) problem with "Leveraginging knowledge" 

Our pitch was loved by the judging panel and we were rewarded for being the most innovative solution by [Hendry](https://www.hendry.com.au/).

Our solution earned us the second place in this hackathon as we were competing against many different industry problems to produce the best IoT/AR technology.
