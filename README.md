# [ThingWorx IoT + AR Hackathon 2018](http://www.thingworxhacks.com/rmit/)

We were tasked with developing an innovative solution for a [LendLease](https://www.lendlease.com/au/) problem with "Leveraging knowledge" 

Our pitch was loved by the judging panel and we were rewarded for being the most innovative solution by [Hendry](https://www.hendry.com.au/).

We finished in 2nd place against all the other competitive teams with industry problems and we were granted $4000 AUD for our prize.
